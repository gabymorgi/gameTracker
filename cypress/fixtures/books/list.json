Their parents are the mastermind behind everything, their plan being to travel in time to find two random guys, nurture them 10 thousand years in future (from their perspective), and travel back in time to... what? It makes no sense. Not even the fact that it is mentioned that time continues passing in Danu Talis while Isis and Osiris are in our present. Not even that, they are defeated by Josh without using any of the Elemental Magics in half a page.\nIs frustrating and sad to see how a story that was planned beforehand could end like that.\nThe only salvageable thing is the final plot twist, when Josh become Marethyu. But is not even so great, because there's not much forshadowing in the previous books. Only a couple of people that mencioned that Josh looks familiar."
